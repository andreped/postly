```

Run streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Testing

For this project, we perform continuous integration to make sure that code is tested and formatted appropriately:

| Build Type | Status |
| - | - |
| **Unit tests** | [![CI](https://github.com/andreped/postly/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andreped/postly/actions) |
| **Check file size** | [![CI](https://github.com/andreped/postly/workflows/Check%20file%20size/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andreped/postly/actions) |
| **Unit tests** | [![CI](https://github.com/andreped/postly/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andreped/postly/actions) |

To perform unit tests, you need to install `pytest`. For running formatting checks you also need `flake8`, `isort`, and `black`. We also depend on `pydantic` for type validation. To do so, lets configure a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run this command to perform unit tests:
```
pytest -v tests/
```

To perform formatting checks, run the following:
```
sh shell/lint.sh
```
